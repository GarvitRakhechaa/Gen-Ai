      "Rebase in git\n",
      "Git rebase is a powerful Git feature used to change the base of a branch. It effectively allows you to move a branch to a new starting point, usually a different commit, by “replaying” the commits\n",

      "Some people like to use rebase over the merge command because it allows you to keep the commit history cleaner and easier to understand. It also allows you to make changes to the code without\n",
      "to the code without affecting the original branch.\n",
      "Here’s a flow example of using git rebase with all the commands involved:\n",
      "Suppose you have a feature branch called feature-branch that you want to rebase onto the main branch.\n",
      "Ensure you are on the branch you want to rebase\n",
      "Terminal windowgit checkout feature-branchgit rebase main\n",
      "This will replay the commits from feature-branch on top of the latest changes in main.\n",
      "Resolve any conflicts\n",

      "Terminal windowgit add <resolved-files>git rebase --continue\n",
      "Try to avoid —force option when using rebase. It can cause issues with the project history. I have seen many horror stories of people using —force to fix conflicts.\n",

      "Terminal windowgit reflog <commit-hash>\n",
      "Recover lost commits or changes\n",
      "If you accidentally deleted a branch or made changes that are no longer visible in the commit history, you can often recover them using the reflog. First, find the reference to the commit where the\n",
      "commit where the branch or changes existed, and then reset your branch to that reference.\n",
      "Terminal windowgit reflog <commit-hash>git reset --hard <commit-hash>\n",

      "you to use Jinja2 templates.\n",
      "Jinja2 templates are written in a simple text format called HTML. The syntax is very similar to HTML, but with some additional features. You need to inject variables into the template using the {{\n",
      "using the {{ variable }} syntax. For example, if you want to display a name, you can use the following code:\n",
      "Hello {{ name }}!\n",

      "the tag will be displayed. If the expression evaluates to False, the content will be skipped.\n",
      "For example, the following code will display a greeting message only if the name variable is not empty:\n",
      "{% if name %}  Hello, {{ name }}!{% endif %}\n",
      "{% for %}\n",
      "{% for %}\n",
      "The {% for %} tag is used to iterate over a sequence of items. It takes a variable name and a sequence as arguments, and displays the content inside the tag for each item in the sequence.\n",
      "For example, the following code will display a list of names:\n",
      "{% for name in names %}  {{ name }} is a name.{% endfor %}\n",
      "{% block %}\n",
      "The {% block %} tag is used to define a block of content that can be overridden in child templates. It takes a name as an argument, and defines a block with that name that can be overridden in child\n",
      "overridden in child templates.\n",
      "For example, the following code defines a base template that includes a header and a footer:\n",
      "<!DOCTYPE html><html>  <head>    <title>{% block title %}My Website{% endblock %}</title>  </head>  <body>    {% block content %}      <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>    {% endblock %}    <footer>\n",

      "{% block content %}  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>  <p>This is a child template.</p>{% endblock %}\n",
      "In this example, the content block in the child template overrides the content block in the base template, and the title block is not overridden.\n",
      "{% include %}\n",
      "The {% include %} tag is used to include the contents of another template file. It takes a template name as an argument, and includes the contents of the template file in the current template.\n",
      "For example, the following code includes the contents of a template file called header.html:\n",
      "{% include \"header.html\" %}\n",

      "{% extends %}\n",
      "{% extends %}\n",
      "The {% extends %} tag is used to extend a base template. It takes a template name as an argument, and extends the base template with the contents of the template file.\n",
      "For example, the following code extends the base.html template with the contents of a template file called child.html:\n",
      "{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n",

      "{% load %}\n",
      "{% load %}\n",
      "The {% load %} tag is used to load a template tag library. It takes a library name as an argument, and loads the template tag library with that name.\n",
      "For example, the following code loads the static template tag library:\n",
      "{% load static %}\n",
      "{% load static %}\n",
      "This will load the static template tag library, which provides a set of template tags for working with static files.\n",
      "{% static %}\n",
      "{% static %}\n",
      "The {% static %} tag is used to include a static file in a template. It takes a file path as an argument, and includes the contents of the file in the current template.\n",
      "For example, the following code includes the contents of a CSS file called style.css:\n",
      "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{% static 'style.css' %}\">\n",
      "This will include the contents of the style.css file in the current template.\n",
      "{% url %}\n",
      "{% url %}\n",
      "The {% url %} tag is used to generate a URL for a view. It takes a view name and a set of arguments as arguments, and generates a URL for the view with those arguments.\n",
      "For example, the following code generates a URL for the index view with the name argument set to 'John':\n",
      "<a href=\"{% url 'index' name='John' %}\">Go to the home page</a>\n",
      "This will generate a link to the home page with the name argument set to 'John'.\n",
      "Apps in Django\n",
      "The most common way to organize your Django project is to use apps. An app is a self-contained module that contains models, views, templates, and other components of your project. Apps allow you to\n",
      "Apps allow you to organize your code into logical units and make it easier to manage and maintain your project.\n",
      "You can create it manually or use the startapp command to create a new app for you. To create an app, navigate to the directory where you want to create the app and run the following command:\n",
      "Terminal windowpython manage.py startapp chai\n",
      "This will create a new directory called chai with the necessary files and directories for an app.\n",
      "To add an app to your project, you need to add it to the INSTALLED_APPS setting in your project’s settings.py file. You can do this by adding the app’s name to the list of installed apps:\n",
      "INSTALLED_APPS = [    'django.contrib.admin',    'django.contrib.auth',    'django.contrib.contenttypes',    'django.contrib.sessions',    'django.contrib.messages',    'django.contrib.staticfiles',\n",
      "'chai',]\n",
      "This will add the chai app to your project’s installed apps.\n",
      "Templates in Apps and layout extension\n",
      "In Django, templates are organized into apps. Each app can have its own templates directory, which contains the templates for that app. Create a new directory called templates in your app’s\n",
      "in your app’s directory. Inside the chai directory, create a templates directory and add a all_chai.html file to it.\n",
      "Add your basic html code to the all_chai.html file.\n",
      "To serve this file, we need a view and a url. Create a new file called views.py in your app’s directory. Add the following code to the file:\n",
      "views.pyfrom django.shortcuts import render\n",
      "def all_chai(request):    return render(request, 'all_chai.html')\n",
      "This view will render the all_chai.html template when it is called.\n",
      "Create a new file called urls.py in your app’s directory. Add the following code to the file:\n",
      "urls.pyfrom django.urls import pathfrom . import views\n",
      "urlpatterns = [    path('', views.all_chai, name='all_chai'),]\n",
      "This urlpattern will map the root URL of the app to the all_chai view.\n",
      "Now, we need to make aware of this new urlpattern in our project’s urls.py file. Add the following code to the project’s urls.py file:\n",
      "urls.pyfrom django.contrib import adminfrom django.urls import path, include\n",
      "urlpatterns = [    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),    path('chai/', include('chai.urls')),]\n",
      "This will include the chai.urls file in the project’s urlpatterns.\n",
      "Now, we can access the all_chai view by going to http://localhost:8000/chai/.\n",
      "Common Layout for all pages\n",
      "In Django, you can create a common layout for all pages in your project by using the base.html template. Create a new file called base.html in your project’s templates directory. Add the following\n",
      "Add the following code to the file:\n",
      "base.html{% load static %}\n",
      "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head>  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{% static 'style.css' %}\">\n",
      "<title>    {% block title %}      Chai aur Django    {% endblock title %}  </title></head><body>  <nav>I will add it later</nav>  {% block content %}  {% endblock %}</body></html>\n",
      "Now, this layout can be used for all pages in your project. To use it, you need to include it in your templates. For example, if you want to use the layout for the all_chai view, you can add the\n",
      "you can add the following code to the all_chai.html file:\n",
      "all_chai.html{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n",
      "{% block title %}  All Chai{% endblock %}\n",
      "{% block content %}  <h1>All Chai</h1>  <p>This is the all chai page.</p>{% endblock %}\n",

      "What is C++?\n",
      "C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the 1980s. It is an extension of the C programming language and is designed to be more efficient, powerful,\n",
      "powerful, and easier to use. C++ is used for developing a wide range of applications, including operating systems, games, and scientific simulations.\n",
      "Why C++?\n",
      "C++ is a powerful language that offers several advantages over C:\n",
      "Performance: C++ is generally faster than C, especially for tasks that require high performance.\n",
      "Memory Management: C++ provides automatic memory management, which helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related issues.\n",
      "Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, which allows for the creation of modular and reusable code.\n",
      "Standardization: C++ is part of the C++ standard library, which provides a set of classes and functions that can be used to develop applications.\n",
      "C++ Syntax\n",
      "C++ code is written in a similar way to C code, but with some additional features. Here are some key differences between C and C++:\n",
      "Preprocessor Directives: In C, preprocessor directives are used to include header files and perform other tasks. In C++, preprocessor directives are used to perform compile-time operations.\n",
      "Namespaces: In C++, namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and provide a way to avoid naming conflicts.\n",
      "Classes and Objects: In C, classes are used to define objects with their own data and functions. In C++, classes are used to define objects with their own data and functions, and objects are created\n",
      "objects are created from classes.\n",
      "Inheritance: In C, inheritance is achieved through the use of pointers and casting. In C++, inheritance is achieved through the use of classes and objects.\n",
      "C++ Features\n",
      "C++ offers several features that make it a powerful language for developing applications:\n",
      "Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, which allows for the creation of modular and reusable code.\n",
      "Platform-Independence: C++ is platform-independent, which means that the same code can be compiled and run on different platforms without modifications.\n",
      "Memory Management: C++ provides automatic memory management, which helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related issues.\n",
      "Statically Typed: C++ is statically typed, which means that the type of a variable is determined at compile-time.\n",
      "Speed: C++ is generally a faster language, especially for tasks that require high performance.\n",
      "Pointers and References: C++ supports pointers and references, which allow for more efficient memory management and manipulation.\n",
      "History of C++\n",
      "C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as a thesis project in the late 1980s. In his Ph.D. thesis, Stroustrup tried Simula to inject Object Oriented Programming (OOP) into the language. However, he\n",
      "However, he found that the language was too complex and difficult to use, so he decided to develop his own language.\n",
      "The first version of C++ was released in 1989, and it was called “C with Classes”. It was a significant departure from C, as it introduced classes and objects, which allowed for more modular and\n",
      "more modular and reusable code. C++ quickly gained popularity and became the de facto standard for C programming.\n",
      "Over the years, C++ has evolved and gained new features and improvements. It has become a powerful language for developing a wide range of applications, including operating systems, games, and\n",
      "systems, games, and scientific simulations.\n",
      "C++ over the years\n",
      "C++ has undergone several major revisions and improvements over the years. Some of the key changes include:\n",

      "the best learning experience, we recommend following these docs alongside our video lectures.\n",
      "This is my personal configuration for Winston logger. You can use it as a reference.\n",
      "Installation\n",
      "To install Winston, you can use the following command:\n",
      "bun      pnpm      npm      yarn      Terminal windowbun add winston morgan  Terminal windowpnpm add winston morgan  Terminal windownpm install winston morgan  Terminal windowyarn add\n",

      "Configuration\n",
      "Configuration\n",
      "To configure Winston, you can create a new file called logger.js in the root directory of your project and add the following code:\n",

      "and timestamps to the console logs.\n",
      "Usage\n",
      "To use the Winston logger, you can import it in your code and use it as follows:\n",
      "First go to your index.js file and add the following code:\n",
      "index.jsimport logger from \"./logger\";import morgan from \"morgan\";\n",
      "const morganFormat = \":method :url :status :response-time ms\";\n",
      "app.use(  morgan(morganFormat, {    stream: {      write: (message) => {        const logObject = {          method: message.split(\" \")[0],          url: message.split(\" \")[1],          status:\n",
      "status: message.split(\" \")[2],          responseTime: message.split(\" \")[3],        };        logger.info(JSON.stringify(logObject));      },    },  }));\n",
      "This will log the messages to the console and the file app.log. The morgan package is used to format the log messages and the stream option is used to write the log messages to the console.\n",
      "Easy log messages\n",
      "To use the Winston logger, you can import it in your code and use it as follows:\n",
      "import logger from \"./logger\";\n",
      "logger.info(\"This is an info message\");logger.error(\"This is an error message\");logger.warn(\"This is a warning message\");logger.debug(\"This is a debug message\");\n",
      "This will log the messages to the console and the file app.log.\n",

      "Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app\n",
      "on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.\n",
      "Django is a full-featured web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It provides a set of tools and libraries for building web applications, including an ORM, a\n",
      "including an ORM, a templating engine, and a built-in admin interface.\n",
      "Environment Setup\n",
      "To get started with Django, you’ll need to install it on your computer. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal, after setting up a virtual environment:\n",
      "MacOS     Windows     Linux      Terminal windowpython3 -m venv .venv\n",
      "# to activate the virtual environmentsource .venv/bin/activate  Terminal windowpython -m venv .venv\n",
      "# to activate the virtual environment.venv\\Scripts\\activate  Terminal windowpython3 -m venv .venv\n",
      "# to activate the virtual environmentsource .venv/bin/activate\n",
      "This is regular way but these days I am using uv to manage virtual environment and other tools. It’s ridiculously easy and fast and cross-platform.\n",
      "MacOS     Windows     Linux      Terminal windowbrew install uv\n",
      "# to create a virtual environmentuv venv\n",
      "# to activate the virtual environmentsource .venv/bin/activate  Terminal windowpowershell -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\n",
      "# to create a virtual environmentuv venv\n",
      "# to activate the virtual environment.venv\\Scripts\\activate  Terminal windowpip install uv\n",
      "# to create a virtual environmentuv venv\n",
      "# to activate the virtual environmentsource .venv/bin/activate\n",
      "Now for all installations, you can use uv pip install command. For example, to install Django, run the following command:\n",
      "Terminal windowuv pip install django\n",
      "uv pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
      "Django Project\n",
      "A Django project is a collection of settings and configurations that define the structure and behavior of a web application. It includes the code for the application, as well as the templates, static\n",
      "templates, static files, and other resources that make up the application.\n",
      "To create a new Django project, you can use the following command:\n",
      "Terminal windowdjango-admin startproject chai-aur-django\n",
      "cd chai-aur-django\n",
      "cd chai-aur-django\n",
      "This will create a new directory called chai-aur-django with the basic structure of a Django project.\n",
      "Start a Django Server\n",
      "To start the Django server, you can use the following command:\n",
      "Terminal windowpython manage.py runserver\n",
      "This will start the server and make it accessible at localhost:8000.\n",
      "Ignore the unapplied migrations warning. This is a common issue when starting a new Django project. We will address this in a later section.\n",
      "Creating our first views\n",
      "Create a new file called views.py in the chai-aur-django directory. In this file, we will define a few views that are simple functions that return a response. We want to have home page, about page,\n",
      "page, about page, and contact page. Each of these pages will return html content.\n",
      "views.pyfrom django.http import HttpResponse\n",
      "def home(request):  return HttpResponse(\"<h1>Welcome to Chai's Django Project: Home page</h1>\")\n",
      "def about(request):  return HttpResponse(\"<h1>Welcome to Chai's Django Project: About page</h1>\")\n",
      "def contact(request):  return HttpResponse(\"<h1>Welcome to Chai's Django Project: Contact page</h1>\")\n",
      "Now, let’s create a new file called urls.py in the chai-aur-django directory. In this file, we will define the URL patterns for our application. If the file is already there, you can just add the\n",
      "can just add the following code to the end of the file:\n",
      "urls.pyfrom django.urls import pathfrom . import views\n",
      "urlpatterns = [  path('', views.home, name='home'),  path('about/', views.about, name='about'),  path('contact/', views.contact, name='contact'),]\n",
      "Now, let’s run the server again and visit the following URLs:\n",
      "localhost:8000\n",
      "localhost:8000/about\n",
      "localhost:8000/contact\n",
      "You should see the following output:\n",
      "Welcome to Chai's Django Project: Home pageWelcome to Chai's Django Project: About pageWelcome to Chai's Django Project: Contact page\n",
      "Adding Templates\n",
      "In Django, templates are used to generate HTML pages. They are used to display data and perform logic in a web application. To create a template, you can create a new file called templates/index.html\n",
      "in the chai-aur-django directory. Make sure that template folder is at same level as manage.py file. In this file, you can write HTML code that will be used to generate the HTML page.\n",
      "templates/index.html<!DOCTYPE html><html>  <head>    <title>Welcome to Chai's Django Project</title>  </head>  <body>    <h1>Welcome to Chai's Django Project</h1>  </body></html>\n",
      "Now, let’s run the server again and visit the http://localhost:8000/ URL. You should see the following output:\n",
      "Welcome to Chai's Django Project\n",
      "Adding CSS and JavaScript\n",
      "To add CSS and JavaScript to your Django project, you can create a new file called static/css/style.css in the chai-aur-django directory. In this file, you can write CSS code that will be used to\n",
      "will be used to style the HTML page. You can also create a new file called static/js/script.js in the chai-aur-django directory. In this file, you can write JavaScript code that will be used to add\n",
      "will be used to add interactivity to the HTML page.\n",
      "static/css/style.cssbody {  background-color: #161616;  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;  color: #fff;}\n",
      "static/js/script.jsconsole.log(\"Hello, world!\");\n",
      "To add this css file go to settings.py and add the following line:\n",
      "settings.pyimport os'DIRS': ['templates'], # inside template section\n",
      "STATIC_URL = '/static/' # below this add the following lineSTATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]\n",
      "In the index.html file, add the following line at the top of the file:\n",
      "{% load static %}\n",
      "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{% static 'css/style.css' %}\">\n",
      "Now, let’s change the home view to use the new template:\n",
      "from django.shortcuts import render\n",
      "def home(request):  return render(request, 'index.html')\n",
      "Now, let’s run the server again and visit the localhost:8000 URL. You should see the following output:\n",

      "Functions in C++ follow this basic syntax:\n",
      "returnType functionName(parameters) {  // function body}\n",
      "Return Type: Specifies the data type of the value returned by the function. Use void if no value is returned.\n",
      "Function Name: Describes what the function does.\n",
      "Parameters: Input values for the function (optional).\n",
      "For example,\n",

      "int main() {  int temp = checkTeaTemperature(85);  // Function call  cout << \"The tea temperature is \" << temp << \"°C\" << endl;  return 0;}\n",
      "Declaring a Function\n",
      "Function declaration tells the compiler about the function’s name, return type, and parameters. It’s also called a function prototype.\n",
      "The function body is defined elsewhere.\n",
      "For example,\n",

      "Defining a Function\n",
      "Defining a Function\n",
      "A function definition includes the full function with the body. You must define the function after declaring it if it’s not inline.\n",

      "Calling a Function\n",
      "Calling a Function\n",
      "To execute a function, you call it by its name followed by parentheses. If the function takes arguments, pass them inside the parentheses.\n",
